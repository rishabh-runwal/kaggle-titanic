# Kaggles's Titanic Challenge
My analysis for the 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster' competition, hosted by Kaggle.com

## About the Problem
The Titanic Problem is based on the sinking of the ‘Unsinkable’ ship Titanic in the early 1912. It gives us information about numerous passengers like their ages, sexes, sibling counts, embarkment points and whether or not they survived the disaster. Based on these features, you have to predict if an arbitrary passenger on Titanic would survive the sinking.
